### Methodology
Since it was the first group project, we decide to all work together, on one computer, and discuss everything we wanted to do and how to do it, instead of splitting the work between us. Like this, we learned differents methods to do the same thing, and choose the one's we agreed on.


### Objectives
Use a python library to collect as much datas as possible.

With this chalenge, we proved that we are :
- Able to scrape a website
- Able to build a dataset from scratch
- Able to implement a strategy to collect as much datas as possible.
